# Interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow by creating a dynamic Coffee Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel. It integrates data from multiple sources, includes thorough data cleaning, and leverages advanced lookup functions (XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH). The final dashboard uses Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers to provide actionable insights into coffee sales trends.

**Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation** – Built interactive charts and dashboards for an intuitive exploration of sales trends.


## Data Source
Dataset: Available on Mo Chen’s GitHub account and youtube video: [https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales]

## Data Cleaning

During this project, I focused on making sure the data was reliable and consistent:

**Data Cleaning & Validation:** Identified and addressed null values, blanks, and errors. Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns. Ensured consistency in data types and formats.

**Data Enrichment:** Used XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH to pull relevant details such as customer name, email, country, coffee type, roast, size, unit price, and loyalty card information.

**Feature Creation:** Added a calculated “Sales” column and created “Coffee Type Name” and “Roast Type Name” columns using IF functions to make the data analysis-ready.


## Data Analysis

I explored the dataset using three pivot tables, each designed to reveal different aspects of sales performance. This approach helped identify how sales varied across time, customer segments, and geographic regions, uncovering trends that were not immediately obvious from the raw data.

## Data Visualization

The interactive dashboard was built on a separate sheet named “Dashboard”. Pivot charts corresponding to the pivot tables were linked and customized for clarity. To make the dashboard more user-friendly, I added three Slicers for filtering by key dimensions and a Timeline control for dynamic analysis over time. This setup allows anyone reviewing the dashboard to easily explore trends and patterns.

## Business Insights

- While working on this project, I discovered several interesting patterns:

- Coffee Type: Liberica coffee generates the highest revenue, highlighting its impact in certain markets.

- Roast Type: “Light” roast is the top revenue contributor overall.

By Country:

- United States: Arabica leads in revenue.

- Ireland: Liberica outperforms other types.

- United Kingdom: Robusta is the primary revenue driver.


These insights could help businesses optimize product focus and marketing strategies in different regions
